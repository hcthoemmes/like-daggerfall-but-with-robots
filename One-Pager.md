The player launches the game. The last time she played, she had left off at the gate of a strange tower, the booming music of the bar she
had stopped at far behind her. She stands now at a threshold, the threshold of something... profitable. She headed in this direction after
her last adventure, clearing out a Yurei-Yakuza base and taking their spoils for herself, and ultimately found herself here. Here, at the
edge of some new treasure. She checks her inventory and sees that she has everything she might need. First aid kit, check. Strength potion,
check. That strange, ethereal katana she took from the yakuza, check. And a backup knife, just in case. All set. She makes a point of
putting on her iron boots, just for funsies, and kicks open the gate. She doesn't know what treasure she'll find this time, but she does
know that she is gonna plunder the hell out of it.

The player launches the game. The last time he played, he had left off at the gate of a strange tower, the warm glow of the last town now
far behind. He stands now at a threshold, the threshold of something new. He started walking in this direction after his previous adventure
discovering the history of the Cook Ranch and its not-quite-human inhabitants, and ultimately found himself here. Here, at the edge of a 
new discovery. He checks his inventory and sees that he has everything he might need. His book of hieroglyphs, check. A length of rope, 
check. That odd gem he found earlier, check. An offering for any deities he may encounter, check. Lastly, an evil spirit ward, just in case.
All set. For good measure, he puts the last few points he has from his last level into Speech - Deity. He walks up to the gate and pulls 
out his book. He solves the riddle of the gate, opens it, and steps inside, still unsure of what mysteries he'll find. But he knows, deep 
down, that whatever they are, he'll solve them.
